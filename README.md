GeometryWarsClone
=================

A [Geometry Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars) clone made in Java and [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/), and uses [BMFont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) for fonts.

This is just an upload of the project found [here](http://eat.sleep.build/Projects/GeoWarsClone/) so that it is easier to browse.

You can download a compiled version on the [project page](http://eat.sleep.build/Projects/GeoWarsClone/), or directly [here](http://eat.sleep.build/files/Geometry_Wars_Clone.zip).

Controls
--------

Building the game
-----------------
This was made using eclipse, and I am not very familiar with java's command line tools, so there is no automated build process provided.
